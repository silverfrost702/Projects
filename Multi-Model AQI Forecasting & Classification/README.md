SmogCast: Air Quality Prediction using XGBoost, LSTM & Transformers

SmogCast is an end-to-end forecasting and classification pipeline for Air Quality Index (AQI) using classical ML and modern deep learning approaches.
This project predicts air pollutant concentrations (PM2.5 & PM10) for the next 7 days and classifies AQI levels using XGBoost.
